## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One of the main things I learned is that when storing files in a CSS folder, we have to return one level to the root directory to find the images folder if it is not saved in the css folder.

```html
<hr class="card__line"></hr>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
background: url("../images/bg-pattern-card.svg");}
```

### Continued development

I am mainly focused on adding Javascript. With DOM manipulation I will be able to dynamically load the cards information from an object.
